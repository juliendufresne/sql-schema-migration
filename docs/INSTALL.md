Installation
============

To run this app, you may chose between 3 modes depending on what you prefer.  
Each mode has its own requirements and a dedicated documentation:

* [docker](/docs/install-on-docker.md) (recommended)
* [raw](/docs/install-on-host.md). Use this only if you are on the same operating system as production servers.
* [vagrant](/docs/install-on-vagrant.md)

The following describes what you can do whatever the mode you choose.

Install
-------

Installation is as easy as:
